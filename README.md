# CIS344_Project1_NonprofitAnimalRescue
This project models a nonprofit animal rescue organization using a relational database. The system tracks adopters, animals, adoptions, adoption items, and donation payments. The database was designed using a Chen-style ER diagram and a UML ER diagram in MySQL Workbench. The schema was successfully forward-engineered and implemented using SQL with primary keys and foreign keys. All required project files are included in this repository!
